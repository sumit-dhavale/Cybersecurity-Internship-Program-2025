**Intern Name:** Sumit Dhavale  
**Intern ID:** 143  
**Internship Task:** Threat Intelligence Collection & Analysis  
**Tools Used:** ThreatView.io, MISP, YARA Rules

## üîç What is MITRE ATT&CK?

[MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) is a globally recognized knowledge base of adversary behaviors that maps real-world attacks into:

- **Tactics** ‚Äì Why an attacker performs an action (e.g., Persistence)
- **Techniques** ‚Äì How the action is performed (e.g., Registry Run Key)
- **Procedures** ‚Äì Specific implementation seen in the wild

## üß† Purpose of TTP Mapping in This Task

In this task, I analyzed IOCs and threat indicators using:
- ‚úÖ **ThreatView.io**: IOC feed lookup for IPs, domains, and hashes
- ‚úÖ **MISP**: IOC sharing platform with structured exports
- ‚úÖ **YARA**: Detection rules for malware and strings in memory/files

These tools help trace observable behaviors to real-world **MITRE techniques**.  
This mapping supports better understanding, detection, and reporting.

## ‚úÖ Why This Matters

- Helps structure incident reports and threat hunting
- Standardizes indicators and behaviors across tools
- Makes reports intelligence-grade for SOCs and analysts
- Aligns your internship learning with real-world frameworks
